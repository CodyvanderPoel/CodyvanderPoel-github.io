            <p>I am from Cascilla, Mississippi, and I graduated from Charleston High School in May of 2018. I am now a student
                enrolled in Base Camp Coding Academy
                <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/" target="__blank__">(BCCA)</a>. Here at Base Camp, our instructors are preparing us to be an Entry-Level Web-Developer. We began
                class June 4, 2018, and we do not graduate till early May of 2019.</p>

                            we used classes and took an Object-Oriented Approach.</p>

                            slow and tasking</p>
